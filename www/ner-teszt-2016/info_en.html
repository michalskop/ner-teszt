<h2>About the test</h2>
<p>Corruptibility is not a “privilege” of those involved in political and economic scandals. Although the magnitudes are different, we all can find ourselves in situations where the risk of corruption is present. It is worth to measure the level of our own propensity for corruption so that we could resist temptation more efficiently when we face it.

<p>Just like in any other field, individual differences can be found in the field of corruption as well; for some, situations of corruption are much more tempting than for others. If we are aware of ourselves being vulnerable to corruption, we have a better chance to deliberately avoid making bad decisions. However, it is important to mention that even if we have an above-average propensity for giving in to the temptation of corruption situations, it does not relieve us of our responsibility if we do give in to them – but we can be very proud of ourselves if we resist.

<p>According to previous researches, the extent of our propensity for corruption depends largely on the level of our loyalty towards our friends and acquaintances. The strong bond between close acquaintances materializes both in morally acceptable and less acceptable situations. It is, of course, commendable and appropriate when friends try to help each other, but we have to notice if the actions friends perform for each other's sake violate the interests of a broader community or are contrary to community values. When acting in behalf of people belonging to our inner circle (members of the family, friends, colleagues, etc.), it is important to take into consideration the possible consequences of our actions on our broader community or communities (neighborhood, town, country, etc.) as well.

<p>In certain countries, including Hungary, relations to family, friends or close acquaintances (known as in-group collectivism) are typically stronger than those to the broader community or social institutions (known as institutional collectivism). These countries have lower economic prosperity, have lower scores on World Competitive Index, have a low level of interpersonal trust and loyalty is valued over efficacy and, most importantly in respect of our test, there is a strong correlation between in-group collectivism and the high level of corruption. In countries characterized by institutional collectivism, the opposite is true. Hence, one antidote of corruption is the ideal balance between our close relationships and our connections to our broader community or communities.
